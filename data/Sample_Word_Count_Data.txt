We begin this book with an introduction to Apache Spark and its rich API .
Understanding the information in part 1 is important for writing high-quality
Spark programs and is an excellent foundation for the rest of the book.
Chapter 1 roughly describes Spark’s main features and compares them with
Hadoop’s MapReduce and other tools from the Hadoop ecosystem. It also
includes a description of the spark-in-action virtual machine we’ve prepared for
you, which you can use to run the examples in the book.
Chapter 2 further explores the VM , teaches you how to use Spark’s command-
line interface (spark-shell), and uses several examples to explain resilient distributed
datasets ( RDD s)—the central abstraction in Spark.
In chapter 3, you’ll learn how to set up Eclipse to write standalone Spark
applications. Then you’ll write such an application to analyze GitHub logs and
execute the application by submitting it to a Spark cluster.
Chapter 4 explores the Spark core API in more detail. Specifically, it shows
you how to work with key-value pairs and explains how data partitioning and
shuffling work in Spark. It also teaches you how to group, sort, and join data, and
how to use accumulators and broadcast variables.

6 Ignored Tips to keep in mind while attending Interviews:

1. Look into the eyes of the Interviewer while answering any questions else it seems disrespectful

2. Keep a smile through out the discussion - I call it a 'Yes Face' because no one likes dull face :)

3. While sitting in a chair, try not to sit on the edge nor lean forward, instead try to sit comfortably

4. Breath, you need to relax, so breath! I have noticed many candidates not breathing but trying to stay firm like a Robot :)

5. Especially for Freshers, don't keep your bags in your lap, try to keep it next to your seat

6. Once Interviewer asks you a question, don't hurry to answer, you can pause for few seconds, gather your thoughts and then answer clearly.
